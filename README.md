Core Vault – Sovereign Edition

Zero-trust, end-to-end encrypted digital vault engineered for autonomous, high-security file custody and legacy governance.

Overview

Core Vault is a sovereign-grade encrypted storage system designed to provide complete user control over digital assets.
Built under a Zero-Knowledge and Zero-Trust architecture, the platform ensures that no plaintext data or encryption keys are ever accessible to the server.

This is not a cloud storage clone.
It is a digital sovereignty infrastructure.
